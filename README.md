# HR-Analytics-Job-switch-of-Data-Scientists
The objective of the project is to explore the datasets, identify outliers, null values and mismatched values and counter them. 
Identify the factors that affect the job switch of Data Scientists from the factors present in the dataset and identify the impact of those factors. 
We will use the exploratory data visualization, linear regression, multinomial regression and a few decision models like 
          1. Generalized linear model - Binomial Distribution
          2. Big vs Small Model
          3. Classify the impact based on anova, F-statistic ratio and p-value.
